## Integrating Zendesk and PagerDuty
Improve customer experiences and increase internal team collaboration by integrating your customer service tools with the PagerDuty tools your engineering teams are already using to monitor and respond to incidents on your platforms. Providing your customer service teams with powerful integrations from within their own apps gives them a powerful tool without leaving their workspace to find the right services or teams to alert when a customer reports an issue.

PagerDuty for Zendesk facilitates cross-team communication between ITOps, DevOps, and your customer service teams. Communication silos are broken down, allowing you to mobilize the right resources across teams, in real time, every time.

Once PagerDuty and Zendesk are linked, Zendesk users can interact with PagerDuty incidents, including creating, acknowledging, and resolving the incidents. Customer service team members can also add notes, such as additional customer data, or send a status update to internal users that might be subscribed to the incident.

Zendesk users can also [trigger PagerDuty incidents from within Zendesk leveraging our new incident command console (pictured below) ](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/zendesk-integration-guide#automatically-trigger-pagerduty-incidents-from-zendesk) as well. When creating a new service in PagerDuty, integrate the service with Zendesk. That service will then receive information via Zendesk Triggers.

Once a Salesforce Cloud object is connected to your PagerDuty instance, new record creations and updates on that object are evaluated against rules that you predefine. If the rule criteria is met, PagerDuty will perform actions specified by those predefined rules.

PagerDuty can also send information to Salesforce Cloud, where you can define the evaluation criteria against the updates made in PagerDuty and select an action to be performed in Salesforce Cloud.
