![Document Title: Customer Service Operations](assets/images/headers/CustServOps-Title.png)

The requirements of digital operations for businesses in any industry can stretch resources and cause stress — for technical teams racing to keep up, for marketing and PR teams striving to stay ahead of potential issues, and for executive teams watching the market and competitors. Digitalization and transformation present new challenges and opportunities every day for organizations of all sizes and industries.

We know that digital operations is a complex mix of distributed systems mastery and in-depth awareness of the broader IT industry ecosystem. Staying on top of and maintaining your organization’s technical platforms can be daunting. It’s easy to miss things when something goes wrong and your team is embroiled in an incident.

One thing you can never, ever go short on is communications with your team and your users during an incident. We highlight the role of the [customer liaison](https://response.pagerduty.com/training/customer_liaison/){:target="_blank" } in our [Incident Response Training](https://response.pagerduty.com){:target="_blank" }. In this guide, we will revisit some of those points — but with a focus on the role of your customer service team in a digital operations environment.

If your team is new to incident response, you can read up on our methods in the other guide, but it isn’t a pre-requisite for the material provided in this guide.

## Who Is This Guide For?
Customer service, sometimes also referred to as customer support, has a critical role to play in the organization’s day-to-day interactions with customers — and this role is even more important when an incident occurs. We prepared this guide to help customer service practitioners and managers establish strong practices with their peers in engineering organizations. Additionally, engineering leaders should not hesitate to partner with their customer service colleagues to ensure the best experience for their customers and end users.

Customer service is a discipline much like any other throughout the digital organization. Customer service teams need access to tooling and automation that can help them accomplish the organization’s goals and provide an ideal customer experience.
